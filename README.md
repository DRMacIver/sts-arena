## What is this?

STS Arena adds an **Arena Mode** to Slay the Spire where you can fight any encounter with any loadout. Use it to:

- **Practice boss fights** before you get there in a real run
- **Test deck ideas** with random or custom loadouts
- **Replay your favorite builds** from past runs against new challenges
- **Challenge yourself** to beat every encounter with one loadout
