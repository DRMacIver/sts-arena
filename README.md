# STS Arena

If you find yourself asking "Does this deck beat Gremlin Nob?", why not just check?
Practice fights in Slay the Spire to improve your tactical play and get a better sense of the strength of different decks. Try your current deck against different fights, experiment with modifications, and use the arena as a training ground to get better at the game proper by training your skill at pilotng different decks.

## What is this?

STS Arena adds an **Arena Mode** to Slay the Spire where you can fight any encounter with any loadout. Use it to:

- **Practice elite fights** before you get there in a real run
- **Test deck ideas** with random or custom loadouts
- **Replay your favorite builds** from past runs against new challenges
- **Challenge yourself** to beat every encounter with one loadout
